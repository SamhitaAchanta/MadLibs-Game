Romeo and Juliet prologue
Two /plural noun/, both alike in dignity, In fair /place/, where we lay our scene, From ancient /noun/ break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes. A pair of star-cross?e /plural noun/ take their life; Whole misadventure piteous overthrows Do with their /noun/ bury their parent?s strife. The fearful passage of their /adjective/ love, and the continuance of their parents? rage, Which but their children?s end naught could /verb/, Is now the /number/ hours? traffic of our stage; The which if you with /adjective/ / body part/ attend, Where shall /verb/, our toils shall strive to mend.
