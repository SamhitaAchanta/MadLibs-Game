Vacations
A vacation is when you take a trip to some cute place with your pretty family. Usually you go to some place that is near a(an) fire or on a(an) remote.  A good vacation place is one where you can ride cars or play Uno or go hunting for slippers. I like to spend my time sitting or reading. When parents go on vacation, they spend their time eating three phones a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around reading. Last summer, my little brother fell in a(an) TV and got poison rose all over his leg. My family is going to go to (the) Peoria, and I will practice walking. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very fun and because they have to work 5 hours every day all year making enough kids to pay for the vacation.
