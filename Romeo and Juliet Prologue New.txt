Romeo and Juliet prologue
Two dfd, both alike in dignity, In fair gfg, where we lay our scene, From ancient tt break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes. A pair of star-cross?e fgf take their life; Whole misadventure piteous overthrows Do with their sd bury their parent?s strife. The fearful passage of their hj love, and the continuance of their parents? rage, Which but their children?s end naught could fsd, Is now the tt hours? traffic of our stage; The which if you with hh hh attend, Where shall dd, our toils shall strive to mend.
